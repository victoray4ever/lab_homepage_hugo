Highlights

•An innovative numerical method for aberration compensations in digital holographic microscopy is proposed.

•The method is via patch-based texture synthesis for hologram inpainting.

•The method can reconstruct the actual object phase from a hologram without polynomial fitting.

•The validation in experiment and simulation confirms the method’s robustness and accuracy in phase retrieval.
