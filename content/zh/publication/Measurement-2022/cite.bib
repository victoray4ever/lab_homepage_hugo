abstract = {Off-axis digital holographic microscopy is widely used to avoid the twin image problem in the hologram, which provides the advantages of extracting the real image. However, the off-axis optical setup and the microscope objective will bring tilt and spherical phase aberrations to the digital reconstruction process. Therefore, it is urgent to explore efficient techniques innovatively to compensate for these aberrations. This study proposes a numerical method via a patch-based inpainting algorithm to eliminate these aberrations. This method can reconstruct the actual object phase from a hologram without polynomial fitting. The reconstruction results in both the experiment and simulation are analyzed and compared, confirming that the proposed method has good robustness and accuracy in phase retrieval.}
