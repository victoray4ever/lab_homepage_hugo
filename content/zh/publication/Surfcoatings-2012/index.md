abstract: By measuring the resonant frequencies of cantilever beams without and with thin films deposited and with the use of the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, elastic modulus and density of thin films can be determined simultaneously. This simple resonant method was validated using a sputtered Ni film/Si substrate system. The elastic modulus of the Ni film obtained from this method was in excellent agreement with that measured by use of nanoindentation.
