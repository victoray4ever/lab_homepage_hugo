Prof. Ma is working in mechanical engineering at [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/), China. **He has presided over three *National Natural Science Foundation projects*, two *Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation projects*, three *Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities*,  and one *Northeastern University Research Start-up Funds for Talents***.

- As the first author (or the first corresponding author), **Prof. Ma has published more than 30 papers in  highly prestigious scientific journals**, such as ***Applied Physics Letters, Optics Express, Journal of Applied Physics, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, Measurement*.** And the papers have been cited more than 300 times. In particular, one of his research results was recommended by the editor-in-chief of Journal of Applied Physics to be **selected as a Featured article of the American Institute of Physics (AIP)** (**J. Appl. Phys. 124, 125306 (2018)**), which was later **exclusively reported** in **AIP Sciligh** with the topic "Mode shape construction provides way for understanding of diaphragm resonator damping mechanism". 

- Since joining NEU in China, Prof.Ma has been actively engaged in teaching for undergraduates. Now he is **the main lecturer of the national first-class undergraduate courses and the national excellent online open course "*Mechanical Engineering Control Fundamentals*"**.He has won Liaoning Provincial Teaching Achievement Awards twice and a number of Northeastern University Teaching Achievement Awards. In addition, Prof. Ma has been named **"Northeastern University Excellent Master Thesis Supervisor"** and **"Northeastern University Excellent Undergraduate Graduation Design (Thesis) Supervisor**" many times.

- Over the years,  **Prof.Ma has served in the [Program Committee](https://marss-conference.org/committees/program-com/) of the International Conference on Manipulation, Automation and Robotics at Small Scales [(MARSS](https://marss-conference.org))** - the flagship event for cross-disciplinary R&D communities related to manipulation and automation at micro and nano scales, and all kinds of small scale robots and their applications . Besides, **he has been a reviewer of highly prestigious scientific journals, such as APL, OE and IJMS.**
