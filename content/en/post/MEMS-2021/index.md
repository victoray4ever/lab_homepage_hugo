Prof. Ma led the graduate students in the laboratory to participate in the "2021 Workshop on Micro-Nano Processing Technology" held at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences on July 12-16. The  Workshop is an excellent training project sponsored by the Microprocessing Laboratory of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and funded by the Personnel Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It mainly provides public welfare course lectures for domestic graduate students and scientific researchers engaged in nano-technology. The workshop combines the basic knowledge of micro-nano processing technology with cutting-edge special reports, and arranges a special introduction to advanced micro-nano processing equipment Trainees in the ultra-clean laboratory; professional teachers in the micro-processing laboratory of the Institute of Physics teach the basics and application knowledge of micro-nano-scale processing technology, and invite well-known experts in the field of micro-nano processing at home and abroad to give cutting-edge academic reports in the field of micro-nano, with rich lecture content , The teaching format is novel and the interaction is active. The teachers and students have benefited a lot from this time.
