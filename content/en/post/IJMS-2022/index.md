Highlights

• A resonant cantilevered micro-plate is proved to be a promising candidate that can sequentially detect multiple particles.

• The identification of multiple particles is regarded as an optimization problem via genetic algorithm to replace the widely-used least squares method.

• Better identification accuracy is illustrated by exquisitely updating the modal shape changes of a micro-plate after each particle adsorption.

• An experimental strategy based on focused ion beam and scanning probe microscopy verifies the applicability of the theoretic framework in designing and evaluating micro/nano sensors.
