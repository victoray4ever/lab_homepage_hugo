Recently, the research group has made new progress in the field of micro-devices. A reporter from the United States, Adam Liebendorfer, interviewed Prof. Ma and wrote an article in AIP Scilight with the title "Mode shape construction provides way for understanding of diaphragm resonator damping mechanism".

Earlier, the Journal of Applied Physics (JAP), a well-known and authoritative international academic journal under AIP, published a research paper "The dynamic characteristics of micro-diaphragms subjected to thermal stress when coupled with a fluid" by Ma Shujun and others. The innovation and importance of the article was highly praised by the journal's editorial board and review experts, and was rated as "one of journal's best" by the editor-in-chief, and was therefore selected as the highlight article of the current issue ( J. Appl. Phys. 124, 125306 (2018) (2018), Featured article), and published in a prominent position on the journal website.
