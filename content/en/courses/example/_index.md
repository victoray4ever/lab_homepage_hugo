# Course title, summary, and position.
linktitle: Fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering Control
summary: This course is a professional platform course of the School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation of Northeastern University. It is a national first-class undergraduate course and a national boutique online open course. The course mainly describes the basic principles of control theory and its application in mechanical engineering automatic control systems. The emphasis is on chapters 1-8, which are the classical control theory. The course will mainly introduce the basic concepts of automatic control, the establishment of the mathematical model of the control system in the time domain and the frequency domain; analyze the stability and steady-state error of the single-input single-output, linear, time-invariant system; explain the time-domain analysis of the linear control system Method, frequency domain analysis method, root locus method and design correction method. Each chapter has engineering case analysis. Chapters 9-11 are self-study parts, which mainly include the basic theory of discrete control system, modern control theory and intelligent control theory. This course is also suitable for electives for students majoring in metallurgy, chemical engineering, material forming and control.

## Teaching goals

The explanation of this course is characterized by strong logic, relatively rigorous, and enlightening. The main goals are:

* **To enable students to properly understand the concepts related to new developments in the field of control theory**
* **To enable students to firmly grasp the basic theories and methods of mechanical control system modeling and analysis**
* **Through experimental operation and introduction to the actual engineering system, students can improve the ability of independent analysis, thinking and self-study, and lay a good foundation for the research of control theory or the practice of control engineering.**


## Pre-knowledge

Courses are mainly aimed at undergraduate students majoring in mechanical engineering, mechatronics engineering, mechanical design and manufacturing and automation, and intelligent manufacturing engineering in general colleges and universities.

Before learning this course, you need to understand and master the courses：`Advanced Mathematics`、`Electrical Engineering and Electronics`、`Mechanical Vibration`、`Test Technology`,etc.
