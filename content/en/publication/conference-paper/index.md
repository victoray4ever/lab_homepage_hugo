abstract: The free vibration of circular diaphragms subjected to in-plane tensile biaxial stress while in contact with a fluid is analyzed using the Rayleigh-Ritz method, in which the linear superposition of a number of polynomial functions is used to describe the displacement of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is placed into a hole in an infinite rigid wall, and the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid. Analytical expressions for the nondimensional added virtual mass incremental factor and the quality factor are easily derived using the proposed method. Our numerical results are validated by comparisons with published theoretical results and a finite element model. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This work demonstrates the thermal stress contribution to the nondimensional added virtual mass incremental factor and the quality factor, which is important in the design of circular-diaphragm-based sensors.
