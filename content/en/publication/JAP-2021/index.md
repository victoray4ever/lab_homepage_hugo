abstract: This paper studies the vibrational behaviors of a distributive mass-loaded microscale circular diaphragm submerged in a fluid. The vibration of the diaphragm involving loadings simultaneously induced by an acoustic field and the adhesion of distributive mass has been investigated. Two different types of adsorbates, namely, in the form of discrete particles (mass only) and a uniform layer (mass and rigidity), are considered and compared. Moreover, the pre-existing stress in the diaphragm has also been taken into consideration. Based on Lamb's hypotheses of the fluid-loaded structure in conjunction with the Rayleigh–Ritz theorem, an analytical solution for the dynamic characteristics of the coupling system, including the resonant frequency, mode shape, and the quality factor, is developed. The results have been compared with those of the finite element simulations, and a good agreement has been obtained. The results reveal that the adsorbate properties contribute differently to the dynamic response of the micro-diaphragm in the fluid, and the contribution may be intervened by tuning the pre-stress. The theoretical model and novel analytical solution are of interest in the design of micro-diaphragm-based biosensing devices.
