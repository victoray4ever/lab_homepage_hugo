abstract = {By measuring the resonant frequencies of cantilever beams without and with thin films deposited and with the use of the Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam theory, elastic modulus and density of thin films can be determined simultaneously. This simple resonant method was validated using a sputtered Ni film/Si substrate system. The elastic modulus of the Ni film obtained from this method was in excellent agreement with that measured by use of nanoindentation.}
